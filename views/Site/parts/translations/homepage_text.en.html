<p>The RuWordNet thesaurus is a thesaurus of the Russian language created in the format of well-known English thesaurus
    WordNet (<a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu">https://wordnet.princeton.edu/</a>). It was constructed using
    semi-automatic transformation of other Russian thesaurus for natural language processing RuThes (<a
            href="http://www.labinform.ru/pub/ruthes/">http://www.labinform.ru/pub/ruthes/</a>).</p>
<p>RuWordNet contains synsets (sets of synonyms) for nouns (single nouns and noun phrases), verbs (single verbs and verb
    phrases) and adjectives:<br>
    - 29297 noun synsets;<br>
    - 12865 adjective synsets;<br>
    - 7636 verb synsets.<br>
    Currently, RuWordNet thesaurus contains 111.5 thousand of unique Russian words and expressions.</p>
<p>Between synsets of the same part of speech, the following relations are established: hyponym-hypernym,
    instance-class, part-whole, antonymy relation, domain relations. For verbs, cause and entailment relations are
    described. Also part-of-speech synonymy links are established between synsets of different parts of speech having
    the same meaning.</p>
